<p>With everything going on in the world, I’ve realized that I’m not going to get to properly say goodbye and thank all of the people that I’ve met during my four years at UT. I figured this project would be the perfect opportunity to do so. And of course I’m going to show off how we can use R and Python to create a pretty cool blog post.</p>
<p>Okay, so step 1 is to use “reticulate” which will allow R and Python to communicate to each other throughout this whole thing.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)</code></pre>
<p>I’m going to be discussing each of the years I spent at UT and I want to start each post with the phrase “Some of my favorite memories this year were”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#this is an R chunk
beg &lt;-&quot;Some of my favorite memories this year were:&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now you can see how I’ve created personalized messages for each of of the four years during my time here in Python. I’ll be using year one as an example.</p>
<div id="year-one" class="section level2">
<h2>Year One</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../yearone.png" />

</div>
<pre class="python"><code>#this is a python chunk
year1=&quot;Meeting my best friend at orientation (s/o Shannon). Our first football game of the season (we beat ND in triple overtime). Running up and down from the first floor of Jester where I lived to the fifth floor where my friends lived. Late night runs to Wendy&#39;s on our way back in from a night out. Spaghetti night at Chris&#39; condo (rip that $5 venmo charge). My first (unofficial) date with my boyfriend (s/o Ryan) at Moojos. Experiencing three days of ACL with one of my best friends (ily Soph). The first and only Texas OU game that I actually bought a ticket for. Staying up late with my roommate talking about anything and everything (miss you Gisela). Kayaking with friends in the middle January. J2 dinner nights. Jumping in the fountain after a Texas win.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now that I’ve created my personalized reflections for year one, I’m going to integrate R and Python.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#this is an R chunk

<p>Kinda crazy to sum up four years into one blog post. So grateful for all of the people that made my time at UT such an unforgettable experience.</p>
