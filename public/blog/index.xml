      <description>With everything going on in the world, I’ve realized that I’m not going to get to properly say goodbye and thank all of the people that I’ve met during my four years at UT. I figured this project would be the perfect opportunity to do so. And of course I’m going to show off how we can use R and Python to create a pretty cool blog post.
Okay, so step 1 is to use “reticulate” which will allow R and Python to communicate to each other throughout this whole thing.</description>
