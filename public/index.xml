      <description>With everything going on in the world, I’ve realized that I’m not going to get to properly say goodbye and thank all of the people that I’ve met during my four years at UT. I figured this project would be the perfect opportunity to do so. And of course I’m going to show off how we can use R and Python to create a pretty cool blog post.
Okay, so step 1 is to use “reticulate” which will allow R and Python to communicate to each other throughout this whole thing.</description>

      <description>Introduction For Project 2, I have chosen to use a Bachelor Dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset looks at a number of features of the Bachelor contestants in seasons 1-15. The initial dataset contained 423 observations, but I narrowed it down to 123 observations, in order to focus on the top 5 home States of the Bachelor Contestants. The original dataset includes the following categorical variables: Name, Occupation and Hometown.</description>

Introduction This project explores different aspects of Netflix Shows and Movies. I chose to combine two datasets by the variable, title. These datasets were each obtained from Kaggle. The first dataset that I obtained consisted of information about the title, director,cast, rating, release year, type, genre, duration, and country in which the show or movie was produced.The second dataset consists of information regarding the title, maturity rating, release year, user rating score and size.</description>
